With this code I'm able to combine a string `"You're running"` with the command `System.getProperty("os.name")`. Putting code together like this could be done with `+` and these are called operators, there is multiple operators to choose from.

{% highlight java %}
import javax.swing.*;

public class Os {
	public static void main (String[] arg) {
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "You're running " + System.getProperty("os.name") + " today.");
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
