In this example I wanted to show how great documentation could be. This makes it a lot easier for other developers to read and use the code. The two most used comment systems are `//` which let you make  comment on 1 row and `/* text */` which could be seperated into multiple lines. I'm also passing the input value from `JOptionPane.showInputDialog()` into the variables firstname and surname. I then combine the strings through the operators to create a sentence.


{% highlight java %}
import javax.swing.*;

public class NameDialog {
	public static void main (String[] arg) {
		String firstname, surname, greeting; // Declaring variables to String
		firstname = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("What is your first name?"); // Input will be stored in variable firstname
		surname = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("What is your surname?"); // Input will be stored in variable surname
		greeting = "Welcome " + firstname + " " + surname; // Variable greeting will store message Welcome + input from firstname and surname
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, greeting); // Creating a message dialog with the stored varibles in greeting
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
