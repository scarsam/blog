In this example I'm using `char` instead of `string` which I currently have been using. `Char` is a single character while `String` is multiple characters. So `Char` is a letter while String is a collection of letters. `Char` is a primitive type, `String` is a class. In this example I'm assigning a unicode with an escape sequence `\` to create letters that you don't see on your keyboard. These could be found on www.unicode.org. I'm assigning this character to the varible `c1` then I'm making it lower case and passing it to varible `c2` then I'm printing them after each other. This will results in c1 being uppercase and c2 being lowercase.


{% highlight java %}
import javax.swing.*;

public class CharO {
	public static void main (String[] arg) {
		char c1, c2; 
		c1 = '\u00D8';
		c2 = Character.toLowerCase(c1);
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, c1);
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, c2);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
